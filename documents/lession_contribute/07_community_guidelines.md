# Module 7: Contributing Guidelines and Community

## Overview

This final module covers the community aspects of contributing to the CLG package: collaboration, code review, project maintenance, and building a healthy open-source community.

### What You'll Learn
- Pull request process and best practices
- Code review guidelines
- Community interaction principles
- Project maintenance and governance
- Long-term sustainability practices

## Contributing Workflow

### 1. Getting Started

#### Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/clg.git
cd clg

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/clg.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
```

#### Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Install development tools
make install-tools  # or manual installation from Module 1

# Run tests to verify setup
go test ./...

# Run linter
golangci-lint run
```

### 2. Making Changes

#### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-process-id
# or
git checkout -b fix/caller-info-race-condition
# or  
git checkout -b docs/improve-readme

# Use descriptive branch names:
# feature/: New features
# fix/: Bug fixes  
# docs/: Documentation changes
# refactor/: Code refactoring
# test/: Test improvements
```

#### Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:
```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
# Examples:
git commit -m "feat(config): add process ID display option"
git commit -m "fix(caller): resolve race condition in getFileInfo"
git commit -m "docs(readme): improve quick start section"
git commit -m "test(config): add tests for new configuration options"
git commit -m "refactor(output): optimize string building performance"
```

#### Commit Best Practices
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Clear messages**: Describe what and why, not just what
- **Reference issues**: Include issue numbers when applicable
- **Sign commits**: Use `git commit -s` for signed-off commits

```bash
# Good commit example
git commit -m "feat(logger): add structured logging support

- Add LogFields type for key-value pairs
- Implement WithFields() and WithField() methods  
- Support both map[string]interface{} and variadic key-value arguments
- Include comprehensive tests and benchmarks
- Update documentation with examples

Closes #123"
```

### 4. Code Review Process

#### For Contributors

##### Responding to Review Comments
```markdown
<!-- Good response example -->
Thanks for the feedback! I've made the following changes:

1. **Thread safety**: Added mutex protection to the new configuration variables
2. **Performance**: Implemented buffer pooling as suggested, see benchmark results below
3. **Documentation**: Added examples and clarified the performance impact
4. **Tests**: Added edge case tests for invalid input validation

Benchmark comparison:
```
BenchmarkOld    1000000    1500 ns/op    5 allocs/op
BenchmarkNew    1500000    1000 ns/op    2 allocs/op
```

Let me know if you'd like any other changes!
```

##### Handling Feedback
- **Be open to feedback**: Reviews improve code quality
- **Ask questions**: If you don't understand feedback, ask for clarification
- **Explain decisions**: If you disagree, explain your reasoning respectfully
- **Learn from reviews**: Use feedback to improve future contributions

#### For Reviewers

##### Review Guidelines

###### Code Quality
- **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Thread safety**: Are shared resources protected properly?
- **Error handling**: Are errors handled appropriately?
- **Performance**: Are there performance implications?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and maintainable?

###### Review Comments Format
```markdown
<!-- Constructive feedback example -->
**Thread Safety Issue**: The new configuration variable `showProcessID` needs mutex protection.

```go
// Current code
var showProcessID bool = false

func SetShowProcessID(show bool) {
    showProcessID = show  // Race condition!
}

// Suggested fix
func SetShowProcessID(show bool) {
    configMutex.Lock()
    defer configMutex.Unlock()
    showProcessID = show
}
```

This follows the pattern used by other configuration functions and prevents race conditions in concurrent environments.
```

###### Review Principles
- **Be constructive**: Focus on improving the code, not criticizing the person
- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines and suggest improvements
- **Explain reasoning**: Help contributors understand why changes are needed
- **Acknowledge good work**: Highlight well-done aspects
- **Balance thoroughness with practicality**: Don't nitpick trivial issues

### 5. Community Guidelines

#### Communication Principles

##### Be Respectful and Inclusive
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community

##### Be Professional
- Keep discussions focused on technical matters
- Avoid personal attacks or inflammatory language
- Be patient with newcomers
- Help maintain a positive environment

#### Helping Others

##### Mentoring New Contributors
```markdown
<!-- Good mentoring example -->
Welcome to the project! I see this is your first contribution - that's great!

A few suggestions to help get your PR ready:

1. **Tests**: Could you add a test for the new feature? You can look at `config_test.go` for examples of the pattern we use.

2. **Documentation**: The function could use a comment explaining when this feature would be useful.

3. **Thread safety**: We need to protect the new configuration variable with a mutex - I can help you with this if you're not familiar with the pattern.

Don't worry about getting everything perfect on the first try - that's what code review is for! Let me know if you have any questions.
```

##### Code Review as Teaching
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Point to existing examples in the codebase
- Suggest learning resources when appropriate
- Offer to help with implementation

#### Conflict Resolution

##### Handling Disagreements
1. **Stay technical**: Focus on the technical merits
2. **Seek understanding**: Try to understand different perspectives
3. **Find compromise**: Look for solutions that address concerns
4. **Escalate appropriately**: Involve maintainers when needed

##### Example Conflict Resolution
```markdown
I understand both perspectives here. Let me suggest a compromise:

**Option A** (original proposal): Simple but may have performance impact
**Option B** (review suggestion): More complex but better performance

**Compromise**: Let's implement Option A for now since it's simpler and meets the immediate need. We can add Option B as an optimization in a future PR if performance becomes an issue.

This approach:
- ✅ Gets the feature working quickly
- ✅ Maintains code simplicity
- ✅ Leaves room for future optimization
- ✅ Doesn't block progress

What do you both think?
```

## Project Maintenance

### 1. Release Management

#### Version Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features (backward compatible)
- **Patch**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

#### Release Process
```bash
# Prepare release
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Update version
echo "v1.2.3" > VERSION

# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Run final tests
go test ./...
golangci-lint run

# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3

Features:
- Add process ID display option
- Improve structured logging performance

Bug fixes:
- Fix race condition in caller info
- Resolve file logging on Windows

Breaking changes:
- None
"

# Push tag
git push upstream v1.2.3
```
